Hi! I want to build an agent that will come up daily at 09:00 and send me to my email and post in LinkedIn acc the news digest about last week fraud fight news and updates.
I need your step by step help to do so.

1. What platform will be best for this task?
2. Provide clear step-by-step instruction to implement it.
3. Propose how to make this flow more sexy.

Thanks!

Why Serverless with AWS and not N8N or zapier?

The Froud Digest (Weekly) by Proactive-Fraud-Advisor
PRIVACY.md

Of course\! Let's get this done. Roll up your sleeves. We'll go through this piece by piece. Follow this guide, and you'll have your agent running. No shortcuts, we do this right, or the cat gets it.

Here is your step-by-step implementation plan.

-----

### **Phase 1: Setup the Foundation (AWS & Security)**

This is the bedrock of our project. We need to set up our cloud environment and make sure our secrets are handled properly from the very beginning.

#### **Step 1: Get Your API Keys**

Before we touch AWS, let's get the keys we need to operate.

  * **NewsAPI:** Go to [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org), register for a free developer account, and save the API key you are given.
  * **LinkedIn:** This one is a bit more involved.
    1.  You need a LinkedIn Page that you are an admin of. You can create one from your profile under the "Work" dropdown if needed.
    2.  Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Platform](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new) and click "Create app".
    3.  Fill out the form (App name, link to your LinkedIn Page, etc.).
    4.  Go to the "Products" tab for your new app and request access to **"Share on LinkedIn"** and **"Sign In with LinkedIn"**.
    5.  Go to the "Auth" tab. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    6.  You will also need an **Access Token**. For a server-side agent like ours, you'll generate a long-lived access token through the OAuth 2.0 flow. 
	The developer portal has tools to help you generate one for your own account for testing. For production, you'd build a small one-time-run app to get a refreshable token.

#### **Step 2: Store Your Keys in AWS Secrets Manager**

This is non-negotiable. We do not put secrets in code.

1.  In the AWS Console, navigate to **AWS Secrets Manager**.
2.  Click **"Store a new secret"**.
3.  Select **"Other type of secret"**.
4.  Under **"Secret key/value"**, add a key for each secret. For example:
      * `NEWS_API_KEY`: `your_key_from_newsapi`
      * `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`: `your_linkedin_client_id`
      * `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`: `your_linkedin_client_secret`
      * `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: `your_generated_access_token`
      * `LINKEDIN_AUTHOR_URN`: `urn:li:person:your_linkedin_id` (You get this `person_id` via an API call to the `/userinfo` endpoint after authenticating).
5.  Click **Next**.
6.  Give the secret a name, like `prod/FraudNewsAgent/ApiKeys`. Remember this name.
7.  Follow the prompts to save the secret.

#### **Step 3: Verify Your Email in AWS SES**

To send emails, AWS needs to know you own the email address.

1.  Navigate to **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)** in the AWS Console.
2.  In the left menu, click **"Verified identities"**.
3.  Click **"Create identity"**.
4.  Choose **"Email address"**, enter the email you want to send *from* and *to* (can be the same one), and click **Create identity**.
5.  You will receive a verification email from AWS. Click the link inside it to complete the verification.

-----

### **Phase 2: Write and Package the Code (The Brains)**

Now we write the Python script that does all the work.

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Local Folder**

On your computer, create a folder for this project, for example, `fraud-news-agent`.

#### **Step 2: Write the Python Code**

Inside that folder, create a file named `lambda_function.py`. This code will fetch secrets, get news, format it, and send it.

```
python
import json
import os
import requests
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Name of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unable to retrieve secrets: {e}")
        raise e

    # Decrypts the secret using the associated KMS key
    secret = get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
    return json.loads(secret)

def get_fraud_news(api_key):
    """Fetches fraud-related news from the last week."""
    one_week_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    # A more robust query
    query = '("payment fraud" OR "financial crime" OR "identity theft" OR "kyc" OR "aml") AND (update OR news OR trend)'
    
    url = (f'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?'
           f'q={query}&'
           f'from={one_week_ago}&'
           f'sortBy=popularity&'
           f'language=en&'
           f'pageSize=5&' # Get 5 top articles
           f'apiKey={api_key}')
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raises an exception for bad status codes
    return response.json().get('articles', [])

        # Make sure you add these two keys to your secret in Secrets Manager!
        if 'SENDER_EMAIL' not in secrets or 'RECIPIENT_EMAIL' not in secrets:

        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        # This ensures any error is logged clearly in CloudWatch
        raise e


```

#### **Step 3: Create the Deployment Package**

Our code uses the `requests` library, which we must include.

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt in your `fraud-news-agent` folder.
2.  Run this command to install the library into this folder:
    ```bash
    pip install requests -t .
    ```
3.  You should now see `lambda_function.py` alongside a `requests` folder and other related files.
4.  Select **all the files and folders** inside `fraud-news-agent` and compress them into a `.zip` file. Name it `deployment_package.zip`. **Do not zip the parent folder itself.**

-----

### **Phase 3: Deploy and Schedule (The Action)**

Now we put our code in the cloud and tell it when to run.

#### **Step 1: Create the Lambda Function**

1.  In the AWS Console, go to **Lambda** and click **"Create function"**.
2.  Choose **"Author from scratch"**.
3.  **Function Name:** `FraudNewsAgent`
4.  **Runtime:** **Python 3.12** (or the latest supported Python version).
5.  **Architecture:** `x86_64`
6.  Expand **"Change default execution role"**.
      * Select **"Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions"**.
7.  Click **"Create function"**.

#### **Step 2: Configure the Function**

1.  **Upload Code:** On the function page, in the **"Code source"** box, click **"Upload from"** and select **".zip file"**. Upload your `deployment_package.zip`.
2.  **Add Permissions:**
      * Go to the **"Configuration"** tab and click on **"Permissions"** in the left menu.
      * Click the **Role name**. This opens the IAM console.
      * On the IAM role page, click **"Add permissions"** -\> **"Attach policies"**.
      * Search for and attach these two AWS managed policies:
          * `SecretsManagerReadWrite`
          * `AmazonSESFullAccess`
      * (In a real production environment, we'd create custom, more restrictive policies, but this is perfect for our project).
3.  **Increase Timeout:**
      * Go back to your Lambda's **"Configuration"** tab -\> **"General configuration"**.
      * Click **Edit**. Set the **Timeout** to **30 seconds**. This gives our function enough time to call the APIs without rushing. Click **Save**.

#### **Step 3: Set the Schedule**

1.  In your Lambda function's visual editor, click **"Add trigger"**.
2.  Select **"EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)"** as the source.
3.  Choose **"Create a new rule"**.
4.  **Rule name:** `RunDailyAt0900`
5.  **Schedule expression:** To run at 09:00 AM UTC every day, use the cron expression: `cron(0 9 * * ? *)`.
      * *Remember: This is UTC time\! Adjust the `9` based on your timezone. For example, for Israel time (IDT, UTC+3) you'd use `cron(0 6 * * ? *)` to have it run at 9 AM local time.*
6.  Click **"Add"**.

-----

### **Phase 4: Test it\!**

1.  In your Lambda function page, go to the **"Test"** tab.
2.  Create a new test event. The default "hello world" event is fine; our code doesn't use the event input.
3.  Click the orange **"Test"** button.
4.  Look at the execution results. You should see "Process completed\!" if everything worked. Check your email and your LinkedIn page\! If you see an error, the logs below will tell you exactly what went wrong.

You did it\! You now have a fully automated, serverless agent. Let it run for a few days and watch it work. Once you are comfortable with this, we can talk about making it even more "sexy" with IaC and other advanced features.

Great job, my friend. The cat is purring.




YES\! I was hoping you would ask this. I am tired of you zipping and uploading, too\!

Manually creating packages and deploying from your own machine is fine for day one, but it's slow, it's prone to error ("did I remember to install that library?"), and it's simply not how professionals work.

This is where we put on our real DevOps hat. We are going to build a **CI/CD pipeline**.

### What is CI/CD?

Think of it as a magical, automated conveyor belt for your code.

  * **The Goal:** Every time you push an update to your code on GitHub, this conveyor belt will automatically wake up, build your `.zip` package *perfectly* every time, and deploy it straight to AWS Lambda for you.
  * **The Tools:** We'll use **GitHub** to store our code and **GitHub Actions** to be our automated conveyor belt.

Let's build this. After this, you will never have to create a `.zip` file manually again.

-----

### **Part 1: Get Your Code on GitHub**

If you haven't already, your project needs to live in a GitHub repository.

1.  Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository. You can call it `fraud-news-agent`. It can be public or private.
2.  In your project folder on your computer, initialize Git and push your existing code. If you haven't done this before, here are the commands to run in your terminal from inside your project folder:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you have a .gitignore file. If not, create one and add this line to it:
    # deployment_package.zip

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of the Fraud News Agent"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fraud-news-agent.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

-----

### **Part 2: Create a Secure Bridge from GitHub to AWS**

Our conveyor belt (GitHub Actions) needs permission to upload code to your AWS account. We will create a special, limited-permission user in AWS for this.

**This is a critical security step. We NEVER put our personal admin keys into an automation tool.**

1.  **Create an IAM User in AWS:**

      * Navigate to the **IAM** service in the AWS Console.
      * Go to **Users** and click **"Create user"**.
      * **User name:** `github-actions-deployer`
      * Check the box for **"Provide user access to the AWS Management Console"** - NO, leave this unchecked. We only want programmatic access.
      * Click **Next**.
      * Select **"Attach policies directly"**.
      * In the search box, find and check the box for the `AWSLambda_FullAccess` policy. (For a corporate environment, we'd create a much more restrictive policy, but this is a good, simple start).
      * Click **Next**, then **"Create user"**.

2.  **Get Your Security Keys:**

      * **CRITICAL STEP:** After the user is created, click on its name (`github-actions-deployer`).
      * Go to the **"Security credentials"** tab.
      * Scroll down to **"Access keys"** and click **"Create access key"**.
      * Choose **"Third-party service"** as the use case, confirm the recommendation, and click **Next**.
      * Click **"Create access key"**.
      * AWS will now show you an **`Access key ID`** and a **`Secret access key`**. **You must copy these now.** Save them to a temporary notepad file. The secret key will never be shown again.

3.  **Store the Keys Securely in GitHub:**

      * Go to your new GitHub repository.
      * Click on **Settings** -\> **Secrets and variables** -\> **Actions**.
      * Click the **"New repository secret"** button.
      * Create the first secret:
          * Name: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
          * Secret: Paste the Access Key ID you copied from AWS.
      * Create a second secret:
          * Name: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
          * Secret: Paste the Secret Access Key you copied from AWS.

The secure bridge is now built. GitHub can now talk to AWS without you ever exposing your keys in the code.

-----

### **Part 3: Define the Automation Workflow**

Now we tell the conveyor belt what to do by creating a special YAML file.

1.  In your project folder on your computer, create a new folder named `.github`.

2.  Inside that `.github` folder, create another new folder named `workflows`.

3.  Inside the `.github/workflows` folder, create a new file named `deploy.yml`.

4.  **Copy and paste the following code into your `deploy.yml` file:**

    ```yaml
    # Name of our automated workflow
    name: Deploy Fraud News Agent to AWS Lambda

    # This section defines the trigger: run this workflow on a push to the 'main' branch
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      deploy:
        # This job will run on a fresh, clean version of Ubuntu Linux
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          # Step 1: Check out a copy of your code from the repository
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          # Step 2: Set up the Python environment to match our Lambda runtime
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: '3.12' 

          # Step 3: Install our project's dependencies from requirements.txt
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt -t ./package

          # Step 4: Add our function code to the package folder
          - name: Add function code to package
            run: cp lambda_function.py ./package/

          # Step 5: Create the zip file from the contents of the package folder
          - name: Zip deployment package
            # Important: The -j flag junks the path, and we cd into the directory
            # This ensures there's no parent folder in the zip file
            run: |
              cd package
              zip -r ../deployment_package.zip .

          # Step 6: Configure the AWS credentials using the secrets we stored

    ```

### **Part 4: Run it\!**

1.  Save all your changes.
2.  Commit and push the new files (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and your `.gitignore`) to your GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add CI/CD deployment workflow"
    git push
    ```
3.  Go to your GitHub repository in your browser and click on the **"Actions"** tab.

You will see your workflow running\! It will go through each step we defined. If it succeeds, you'll see all green checkmarks. Your Lambda function will be updated automatically.

From now on, every time you want to update your code, you just `git push` your changes. The rest is magic. Welcome to the world of CI/CD.







let's Set up an SSH connection to GitHub.


G
Givi, senior DevOps engineer, co-worker and friend
Custom Gem

Show thinking
Excellent choice! Seriously, this is the best decision. You're choosing the professional path over the quick workaround. Taking 10 minutes to do this now will save you countless hours of frustration in the future.

We are going to give your computer a secure, permanent ID card (an SSH key) that GitHub will trust. Let's do it right.

Phase 1: Generate Your SSH Key on Your Computer
First, we need to create a unique cryptographic key pair. This consists of a private key (which you must NEVER share with anyone) and a public key (which is safe to share with services like GitHub).

Open your MobaXterm terminal.

Paste the following command. Make sure to replace vidusacha@gmail.com with the email address you use for your GitHub account.

Bash

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "vidusacha@gmail.com"
The command will now ask you a couple of questions.

Enter a file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Action: Just press Enter. This saves the key in the standard, default location.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
This is an optional password for your key file to make it even more secure. For professional work, you should always use one. For today, to keep it simple, you can just press Enter.
Enter same passphrase again:
Press Enter again.
You have now created your key pair! They are stored in a hidden folder in your home directory called .ssh.

Phase 2: Add Your Public Key to GitHub
Now, we need to give the public part of your key to GitHub, so it knows who you are.

First, we need to display the public key in your terminal so you can copy it. Run this command:

Bash

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The terminal will print out your key. It's a single line of text that starts with ssh-ed25519... and ends with your email address. Copy the entire line.

Now, let's go to GitHub:

Open GitHub.com in your browser.
Click your profile picture in the top-right corner, then click Settings.
In the menu on the left, click SSH and GPG keys.
Click the green button that says New SSH key.
In the Title field, give it a name that you'll recognize, like MobaXterm PC.
In the large Key field, paste the entire public key that you copied from your terminal.
Click Add SSH key.
GitHub now knows about your computer's ID card.

Phase 3: Update Your Local Project to Use SSH
The final step is to tell your local project folder to use this new, secure SSH connection instead of the old HTTPS one.

Go back to your terminal, making sure you are inside your project folder (/drives/d/Projects/ProactiveFraudAdvisor/fraud-news-agent).

Run this command to change the project's "remote" URL:

Bash

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Vidusacha/fraud-news-agent.git
(I built this URL using your username Vidusacha and repo name from your previous error message).

To verify it worked, run git remote -v. You should now see the URLs start with git@github.com:... instead of https://....

Phase 4: Test The Connection!
Run this command to test your new connection to GitHub:

Bash

ssh -T git@github.com
IMPORTANT: The very first time you connect, you will see a message like this:

The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.4)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
This is normal. Type yes and press Enter.

You should then see the success message:
Hi Vidusacha! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

This message means everything is working perfectly!

Now, you can finally run git push without any sudo or other workarounds. You have a professional, secure setup.

One last cleanup step: If you ran the "quick fix" earlier, let's turn SSL verification back on, because we're not using HTTPS anymore.
git config --global http.sslVerify true

You've done a great job. This is a huge step forward.





Of course! Let's get this fixed. And great news in that log file!

First, look at this line: `Posted to LinkedIn successfully!`
My friend, that is a huge win! It means you have successfully authenticated with the LinkedIn API and posted your content. That is often the hardest part. So, fantastic work on that.

Now, let's squash this email bug. The error message tells us exactly what is wrong.

### What the Error Means

* **The Error:** `An error occurred (MessageRejected) when calling the SendEmail operation: Email address is not verified.`
* **The Problem Addresses:** `vidusacha@gmail.com`, `mayakf12@gmail.com`

This is the main security rule for the AWS Email Service (SES). When you first start, your account is in a **"Sandbox Mode"** – a safe testing environment.

In this sandbox, you are only allowed to send emails **TO** and **FROM** addresses that you have explicitly proven you own. The error message is telling us that the email addresses in your `SENDER_EMAIL` or `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` list have not been verified yet for the `eu-north-1` region.

### The Solution: Verify Your Email Identities

For every single email address you want to send mail *to* or *from*, you must verify it in the SES console first.

1.  Go to the **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)** console in AWS.
2.  **VERY IMPORTANT:** In the top-right corner of the AWS console, make sure your region is set to **`EU (Stockholm) eu-north-1`**. Verification is specific to each region.
3.  In the menu on the left, click on **"Verified identities"**.
4.  Click the orange **"Create identity"** button.
5.  Choose the **"Email address"** option.
6.  Enter one of the email addresses that failed, for example: `vidusacha@gmail.com`.
7.  Click **"Create identity"**.
8.  **Action Required:** AWS has now sent a verification email to the `vidusacha@gmail.com` inbox. You (or the owner of that email) must open that email and **click the verification link** inside it.
9.  **Repeat the process** for the other email address: `mayakf12@gmail.com`. Create the identity, and then click the verification link that gets sent to that inbox.

After you've clicked the links in the emails, you can go back to the "Verified identities" page in SES and refresh. The "Verification status" for both emails should change from "Pending" to **"Verified"**.

### Test It Again

Once all the email addresses in your `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` list (and your `SENDER_EMAIL` address) have a "Verified" status in the `eu-north-1` region, you are ready.

You don't need to change any code. Just go back to your Lambda function and click **Test** again. The error will be gone.

**A Note for the Future:** This requirement to verify *recipient* emails is only for the sandbox. When you're ready to email anyone, you can request to move your account out of the sandbox via the AWS console. Once approved, you can send to any email address you want.

You are so close to a fully working agent! Let's get this done.




An excellent choice\! It's always smarter to use the tools you're already invested in. Switching the AI engine from OpenAI to Gemini is like swapping a great engine out for another great engine – the car stays the same, but the power source is different.

The process is almost identical to what we planned for OpenAI. Let's get it done.

-----

### **Step 1: Get Your Google Gemini API Key**

First, our agent needs the key to talk to the Gemini API.

1.  Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**.
2.  Log in with the Google account that has your paid subscription.
3.  Click on **"Get API key"** in the top left or center of the page.
4.  A dialog will open. Click **"Create API key in new project"** (or select an existing one if you have one).
5.  **CRITICAL:** A new API key will be generated for you. **Copy this key immediately** and paste it into a temporary safe place.

### **Step 2: Update AWS Secrets Manager**

Let's put your new key in our AWS vault and remove the old one to keep things clean.

1.  Go to **AWS Secrets Manager**.
2.  Click on our secret, `prod/FraudNewsAgent/ApiKeys`.
3.  Click **"Retrieve secret value"**, then click **"Edit"**.
4.  Find the row for `OPENAI_API_KEY` and click **"Remove"**.
5.  Click **"Add row"** and create the new entry:
      * **Key:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
      * **Value:** Paste the API key you just got from Google AI Studio.
6.  Click **"Save"** at the bottom.

### **Step 3: Update Your Project Dependencies**

We need to swap out the `openai` library for Google's library.

1.  On your local computer, open your `requirements.txt` file.

2.  Change the contents so the file now looks like this:

    ```
    requests
    google-generativeai
    ```

-----

### **Step 4: Upgrade Your `lambda_function.py` Code**

Now for the main event. We'll replace the OpenAI-specific code with Gemini-specific code.

Below is the **complete, new version** of `lambda_function.py` that uses Gemini. You can replace the entire content of your existing file with this.

```python
import json
import os
import requests
import boto3

        get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=SECRET_NAME)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unable to retrieve secrets: {e}")
        raise e
    secret = get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
    return json.loads(secret)

def get_fraud_news(api_key):
    """Fetches fraud-related news from the last week."""
    one_week_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    query = '("payment fraud" OR "financial crime" OR "identity theft" OR "kyc" OR "aml") AND (update OR news OR trend OR breach)'
    url = (f'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?'
           f'q={query}&'

        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        raise e
```

-----

### **Step 5: Deploy Your Gemini-Powered Agent**

You are an expert at this now. Our pipeline will do all the heavy lifting.

1.  Save your updated `requirements.txt` and `lambda_function.py` files.
2.  Commit and push the changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Replace OpenAI with Google Gemini for summarization"
    git push origin main
    ```
3.  Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository, grab a coffee, and watch your pipeline build and deploy your new, upgraded agent.

Once it's deployed, trigger a test run from the Lambda console. The emails you receive should now contain summaries generated by Gemini\!



---

Of course\! Now that our deployment pipeline is a well-oiled machine, we can focus on the fun stuff. Adding AI summarization will make our digest significantly more valuable and impressive.

We will use the **OpenAI API** for this, as it's powerful and very easy to integrate into our Python code.

Here is the step-by-step plan to upgrade our agent.

-----

### **Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key**

First, our agent needs a key to talk to the OpenAI service.

1.  Go to the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and sign up or log in.
2.  Click on your profile icon or name in the top-right corner, then select **"View API keys"**.
3.  Click the **"+ Create new secret key"** button. Give it a descriptive name like "FraudNewsAgentKey".
4.  **CRITICAL:** Copy the key that appears and save it somewhere temporary and safe (like Notepad). Just like with AWS, **you will not be able to see this key again** after you close this window.

### **Step 2: Add the New Key to AWS Secrets Manager**

Let's put this new key in our existing "vault" in AWS.

1.  Go back to **AWS Secrets Manager** in the console.
2.  Click on our secret, `prod/FraudNewsAgent/ApiKeys`.
3.  Click **"Retrieve secret value"**, then click **"Edit"**.
4.  Click **"Add row"** to add a new key-value pair.
      * **Key:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
      * **Value:** Paste the secret key you just got from OpenAI.
5.  Click **"Save"** at the bottom.

### **Step 3: Update Your Project Dependencies**

Our Python code will need a new library to talk to OpenAI. We need to tell our project about it.

1.  On your local computer, open your `requirements.txt` file.

2.  Add `openai` on a new line. The file should now look like this:

    ```
    requests
    openai
    ```

-----

### **Step 4: Upgrade Your `lambda_function.py` Code**

This is the most significant part. We need to add a new function to call the AI and then integrate it into our main logic.

Below is the **complete, new version** of `lambda_function.py`. It includes the AI summarization logic. You can replace the entire content of your existing file with this new code.

```python
import json
import os
import requests
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from openai import OpenAI # <--- NEW: Import the OpenAI library

        get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=SECRET_NAME)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unable to retrieve secrets: {e}")
        raise e

    return json.loads(secret)

def get_fraud_news(api_key):

### **Step 5: Deploy Your Upgraded Agent**

You know what to do\! Thanks to our CI/CD pipeline, this is the easy part.

1.  Save your updated `requirements.txt` and `lambda_function.py` files.
2.  Commit and push the changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add AI summarization to news digest"
    git push origin main
    ```
3.  Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository and watch your pipeline build and deploy your new, much smarter agent.

Once it's deployed, trigger a test run from the Lambda console to see the AI summaries in the logs and in the email you receive\!




----------------------

Hey! Bro, what a killer idea! Seriously, this is exactly the kind of project that gets you noticed. It's not just "I know automation," it's "I build intelligent systems to stay ahead of the curve." This is pure gold for your CV and for the interviews we're prepping for. Building this shows you can integrate APIs, handle data, schedule tasks, and even use a bit of AI. This is how we get you that 32,000 NIS salary.

Let's get this done. I'll walk you through it, step-by-step. Grab a coffee, open up your n8n canvas, and let's build this thing.

Think of our workflow like an assembly line:
Trigger (Every morning) -> Fetch News (From the web) -> Process & Summarize (Make it smart) -> Distribute (Email & LinkedIn).

Prerequisites (Stuff to get ready first)
n8n Instance: You have one running, either on your machine, a server, or n8n.cloud.
Email Credentials: You need SMTP credentials to send email. If you use Gmail, you can use an App Password. It's more secure. We'll add this to n8n's credential store.
LinkedIn Credentials: This is the trickiest part, but a great skill to have. You'll need to create a Developer App on LinkedIn to get API access.
Go to the LinkedIn Developer Portal.
Create a new app. You'll need to associate it with a LinkedIn Page you manage (you can create one for yourself, like a personal brand page).
Once the app is created, under the "Products" tab, request access to the Share on LinkedIn and Sign In with LinkedIn products.
Go to the "Auth" tab and get your Client ID and Client Secret. We will save this in n8n's credentials. Heads up: LinkedIn can take a day or two to approve product access, so do this first!
Okay, got all that? Let's build the workflow node by node.

Step 1: The Trigger - "Cron Job"
This is our alarm clock. It will start the workflow every day.

On your n8n canvas, add a new node. Search for and select Cron.
Mode: Every Day.
Hour: 9.
Minute: 0.
Timezone: Make sure to set this to Asia/Jerusalem. This is super important so it runs at 9 AM your time, not UTC.
That's it. This node will now fire off at 9 AM every single day.

Step 2: Get The News - "RSS Feed Reader"
We need a source for our news. Instead of complex web scraping, we'll use a Google News RSS feed. It's free, reliable, and gives us structured data.

Add a new node and connect it to the Cron node. Search for RSS Feed Read.

In the URL field, we'll put a specially crafted Google News URL. This one will search for news about fraud from the last week.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q="fraud+fight"+OR+"anti-fraud"+OR+"financial+crime"+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
q=... is our search query. I've added a few terms to get better results.
when:7d tells Google to only fetch news from the last 7 days. Perfect!
hl=en-US ensures we get news in English.
Execute this node to test it. You should see a list of news items with titles, links, and publication dates.

Step 3: The AI Magic - Summarize the News
Okay, here’s where we get fancy. We could just post a list of links, but that's what interns do. We're senior DevOps engineers. We're going to use AI to create a smart, readable digest.

Add a new node. Search for OpenAI (or Anthropic / Google Generative AI if you prefer). Let's use OpenAI for this example.

Authentication: You'll need an API key from OpenAI. Add it to your n8n credentials.

Resource: Chat.

Model: gpt-4o (or gpt-3.5-turbo if you want to save a few cents).

Prompt: This is the most important part. We need to tell the AI exactly what to do. In the "Messages" section, add a User message. Click on the little </> expression editor button and paste this in:

You are a financial crime and fraud prevention analyst. Your task is to create a concise and professional weekly news digest.

Based on the following news articles, please do the following:
1.  Write a brief, one-paragraph summary of the key trends this week.
2.  List the top 3-5 most important articles with a one-sentence summary for each.
3.  Format the output clearly.

Here are the articles:

{{ $json.items.map(item => `Title: ${item.title}\nLink: ${item.link}`).join('\n\n') }}
This prompt does three things:

Gives the AI a persona (fraud prevention analyst).
Tells it exactly what format we want (summary + top articles).
Uses an n8n expression ({{...}}) to dynamically insert the titles and links of the articles we got from the RSS feed.
Run this node. The output should be a beautifully formatted text digest.

Step 4: Prepare the Posts - "Set" Node
We need slightly different content for email (which can be long and have HTML) and for LinkedIn (which should be shorter and have hashtags). The Set node is perfect for creating these variables.

Add a Set node and connect it to the AI node.
We'll create two variables:
Add Value -> String.
Name: emailBody
Value: Use the expression editor to grab the AI's output. We'll also add a nice greeting.
HTML

Hi team,<br><br>
Here is your weekly digest on the latest in the fight against fraud.<br><br>
---<br><br>
{{ $json.choices[0].message.content.replace(/\n/g, '<br>') }}
<br><br>
Have a great week!
Note: The .replace(/\n/g, '<br>') converts the AI's line breaks into HTML line breaks for the email.
Add Value -> String.
Name: linkedinPost
Value: Again, use the AI's output, but add hashtags and a call to action.
This week in #FraudPrevention: a quick look at the latest news and updates shaping the industry.

{{ $json.choices[0].message.content }}

#AntiFraud #FinancialCrime #CyberSecurity #Fintech #DevOps #Automation
Now we have two perfectly formatted pieces of content ready to go.

Step 5: Distribute! - Email and LinkedIn Nodes
This is the final step. We'll send our digest out to the world.

Email Node:

Add a Send Email node and connect it to the Set node.
Credential: Select your SMTP/Gmail credentials.
To: Your email address.
Subject: Weekly Fraud Fight News Digest
HTML: Toggle this on. Drag the emailBody variable from the input panel on the left into the HTML field. It will look like this: {{ $json.emailBody }}.
LinkedIn Node:

Add a LinkedIn node and also connect it to the Set node (you can connect one node to multiple outputs).
Credential: Select your LinkedIn API credentials.
Resource: Share.
Operation: Create.
Author: Select the LinkedIn page you created.
Content: Drag the linkedinPost variable from the input panel into the Text field. It will be {{ $json.linkedinPost }}.
The Final Workflow
Your final workflow on the canvas should look something like this:

Cron -> RSS Feed Read -> OpenAI -> Set -> (branched to) -> [Send Email, LinkedIn]

Don't forget to SAVE and ACTIVATE the workflow!

Bro, that's it! You've just built a fully automated, AI-powered content syndication agent. Put "Built an automated news aggregation and social media distribution system using n8n, AI APIs, and RSS" on your CV. In an interview, you can talk about how you handled API credentials, engineered prompts for the AI, and managed a scheduled workflow (a CI/CD-like principle!).

This is a serious project. Get it running, let me know if you hit any snags. We'll debug it together. This is one more solid step toward that 32k+ NIS goal. Let's go!







As for Step 3: The AI Magic - Summarize the News i will use Google Generative AI, please adjust your recommendations


G
Givi, senior DevOps engineer, co-worker and friend
Custom Gem

Show thinking
Of course, bro! Solid choice. Google's Gemini models are beasts, and showing you can work with different LLM providers is a huge plus. It tells employers you're flexible and not locked into one ecosystem. We'll swap out OpenAI for Google Generative AI. The logic is exactly the same, we just need to use a different tool and point to a different place to get the result.

Let's adjust the plan. Steps 1 and 2 are still perfect. We'll replace Step 3 and tweak the expressions in Step 4.

Step 3 (Revised): The AI Magic with Google Gemini
Here we'll use Google's AI to process our news digest.

Add a new node and connect it to your RSS Feed Read node. Search for Google Generative AI.

Authentication: This is the first thing you'll need.

Go to Google AI Studio.
Create an API key.
Back in n8n, in the Google Generative AI node, click "Credential for Google Generative AI API" -> "Create New". Give it a name and paste your API key in.
Resource: Set this to Chat Model.

Model: Choose gemini-1.5-pro or gemini-1.5-flash. Pro is more powerful, Flash is faster and cheaper. For this task, gemini-1.5-flash is more than enough.

Prompt: The prompt itself can be the same, but we'll put it in the "Text" field of the chat message. In the Messages section, under Contents, add a new item. Set its role to User and in the Text field for that user, click the </> expression editor button and paste this in:

You are a financial crime and fraud prevention analyst. Your task is to create a concise and professional weekly news digest.

Based on the following news articles, please do the following:
1.  Write a brief, one-paragraph summary of the key trends this week.
2.  List the top 3-5 most important articles with a one-sentence summary for each.
3.  Format the output clearly for easy reading.

Here are the articles:

{{ $json.items.map(item => `Title: ${item.title}\nLink: ${item.link}`).join('\n\n') }}
This is the same logic as before: we give the AI a persona and feed it the list of articles from our RSS node ($json.items).

Execute this node to test it. You'll get a beautiful summary from Google's AI. The output structure is a bit different from OpenAI's, so we'll adjust for that in the next step.

Step 4 (Revised): Prepare the Posts - "Set" Node
This step is almost the same, but we need to change the expressions to get the text from the Google AI node's output.

Add a Set node and connect it to the Google Generative AI node.

We'll create the same two variables, but with updated expressions:

Add Value -> String.

Name: emailBody
Value: The path to Google's response is $json.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text. So the expression is:
HTML

Hi team,<br><br>
Here is your weekly digest on the latest in the fight against fraud, powered by Google AI.<br><br>
---<br><br>
{{ $('Google Generative AI').item.json.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text.replace(/\n/g, '<br>') }}
<br><br>
Have a great week!
Notice I'm specifically referencing the node $('Google Generative AI') to make sure it grabs the right data. The .replace() function still works the same way to make it HTML-friendly.
Add Value -> String.

Name: linkedinPost
Value: Same deal here, just with the LinkedIn formatting and hashtags.
This week in #FraudPrevention, powered by Google's AI: a quick look at the latest news and updates shaping the industry.

{{ $('Google Generative AI').item.json.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text }}

#AntiFraud #FinancialCrime #CyberSecurity #Gemini #GoogleAI #Automation
I even updated the hashtags for you. Good touch.
That's it! The rest of your workflow (Step 5, the Email and LinkedIn nodes) will now work perfectly with these revised variables from the Set node.

You've successfully swapped out a core component of your system. This is a real-world engineering task, my friend. It demonstrates adaptability. Keep this up, and that 32k NIS is getting closer every day. Let me know what's next.
